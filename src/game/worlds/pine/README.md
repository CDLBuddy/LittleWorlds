# 🌲 Pine Trails World

## Overview

The **Pine Trails** mark the turn toward evening—where the path climbs, the wind speaks through needles, and golden resin teaches patience. This is the world of ascent, preparation, and the first whisper of night. Here, the lantern is earned, not given, and the twins learn that light must be gathered before darkness comes.

---

## 🌄 Atmosphere & Time of Day

**Time:** Late afternoon sliding into early golden hour  
**Mood:** Climbing confidence, anticipation, gathering before dusk  
**Color Palette:** Deep forest greens, amber pine needles, golden resin, warm pre-dusk glow  
**Lighting:** Angled sun through tall pines (god rays), long shadows stretching east, amber-orange gradient in sky

### Audio Landscape
- **Primary:** Wind through pine needles (constant whisper, higher pitch than broadleaf forest)
- **Texture:** Pine creak (tall trunks swaying), cone drop (occasional *thunk*), needle scatter underfoot
- **Wildlife:** Woodpecker (distant percussion), chickadee (higher altitude calls), hawk cry (far above)
- **Wind Gusts:** Comes in waves, louder at trail bends (dramatic, not threatening)
- **Vista Echo:** Faint creek babble behind (Creek), cricket chirps ahead (Dusk Firefly meadow)

---

## 🎯 Core Design Philosophy

Pine Trails introduces **preparation and resource gathering**. It teaches:
- **Sap Collection:** Boy's tool used for gathering (slingshot → knock pinecones, reveal sap)
- **Lantern Crafting:** Girl's knowledge applied (field guide shows lantern assembly)
- **Trail Navigation:** Path-finding with subtle markers (cairns, bent branches) Create better lighting by placing the crafted lanterns at certain locations.
- **Elevation Change:** Gentle uphill terrain (first "climb" without danger)
- **Time Pressure (Soft):** Light is fading—lantern needed for next area (no timer, just atmosphere)

**Key Principle:** *"Gather before nightfall. The forest rewards the prepared."*
